Is this lang sus?

### Mate, what is this??

This is an esolang in the theme of the game "Among Us". All syntax, VM and bytes are AMONG US based.

### Can i use this yet?

Nah, im starting work on this rn. I have upcoming exams, so i will start actual work on this by October 13th. Thanks for being patient :)

### Notice:

I do not own nor have made among us. All the credit goes to the company [Innersloth](https://www.innersloth.com/) for the game. This is just an esolang implementation.
